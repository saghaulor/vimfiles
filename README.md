Setup
-----
Download bootstrap.rb and run it. It will download the git repo and get to work. 
You'll be rocking with a sensible but not too heavy vim setup in minutes.
    $ ruby -e bootstrap.rb
Notes
-----
This script will install my vim files including my vimrc to your homedir. Additionally, it will install exuberant ctags, and all the vim plugins that I use. If you have node.js installed it will also install jsctags.
